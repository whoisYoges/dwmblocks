# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
# usage
To use dwmblocks first run 'make' and then install it with 'sudo make install'.
After that you can put dwmblocks in your xinitrc or other startup script to have it start with dwm.
# modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
By default the blocks.h header file is created the first time you run make which copies the default config from blocks.def.h.
This is so you can edit your status bar commands and they will not get overwritten in a future update.
# signaling changes
Most statusbars constantly rerun every script every several seconds to update. This is an option here, but a superior choice is giving your module a signal that you can signal to it to update on a relevant event, rather than having it rerun idly.

For example, the brightness module has the update signal 5 by default. Thus, running `pkill -RTMIN+5 dwmblocks` will update it.

You can also run `kill -39 $(pidof dwmblocks)` which will have the same effect, but is faster. Just add 34 to your typical signal number.

My brightness module never updates on its own, instead I have this command run along side my brightness shortcuts in dwm to only update it when relevant.

*Note that all modules must have different signal numbers.*
# patches
Here are some patches to dwmblocks that add features that I either don't want to merge in, or that require a dwm patch to work.
I do not maintain these but I will take pull requests to update them.
